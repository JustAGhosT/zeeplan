- **Target:** R544K-1.46M revenue (+133-392%)

### Year 4-5: Maturity

## Win-Win-Win Outcome (5-Year Total Income)

| Partner | Current Income | Future Income (5-Year) | Growth |
|---------|----------------|------------------------|--------|
| **Oom Willie** | R210K-245K | R618K-1.41M | +194-476% |
| **Eben** | R210K-245K | R618K-1.41M | +194-476% |
| **Hans** | R0 | R995K-1.78M | N/A (new partner) |

**Key Benefit:** Everyone's absolute income increases massively, even though equity % adjusts

## Risk Mitigation

- **Year 1 zero equity:** Hans proves value before earning ownership
- **Family control:** Oom Willie + Eben maintain 70% combined (always majority)
- **Performance-based:** Hans only earns equity by hitting revenue targets
- **Exit clauses:** Clear buyout terms at Year 3 or Year 5
- **Downside protection:** Hans's salary (R120K-180K/year) covers living expenses

## Next Steps

1. **Week 1-2:** Schedule meeting with Oom Willie + Eben, present proposal
2. **Week 3-4:** Land valuation, livestock count, infrastructure audit
3. **Month 1-3:** Partnership agreement, legal setup, baseline assessment
4. **Month 4+:** Begin Year 1 implementation (sekelbos clearing, livestock transfer, systems setup)

### 7.2 Monitoring Schedule

#### Daily:
- Feed and water checks (all pigs)
- Health observations (behavior, appetite, droppings)
- Farrowing checks (pregnant sows, 2-4 times daily)
- Fencing checks (predator protection)

#### Weekly:
- Body condition scoring (breeding stock)
- Piglet weighing (track growth rates)
- Paddock rotation (mobile system)
- Infrastructure maintenance (shelters, fencing)

#### Monthly:
- Financial tracking (revenue, costs, profitability)
- Breeding records (farrowings, litter sizes, survival rates)
- Health treatments (vaccinations, deworming schedule)
- Feed inventory (order ahead, prevent shortages)

#### Quarterly:
- Veterinary consultations (herd health review)
- Breeding stock evaluation (cull poor performers)
- Market analysis (pricing, demand, competition)
- Strategic planning (adjust production, marketing)

#### Annually:
- Full financial review (profit/loss, ROI)
- Herd genetic evaluation (breeding decisions, replacements)
- Infrastructure assessment (repairs, expansions)
- Strategic planning (next year targets, investments)

## CONCLUSION

The Pig Enterprise is a high-value, strategic component of the Zeerust regenerative agriculture system:

### Key Strengths:

- **Rare genetics:** Mukota breed (critically endangered, <500 globally) = extreme premium value
- **Hybrid vigor:** Three-way cross (Mukota/Duroc/Large White) = superior performance + hardiness
- **Sekelbos integration:** Phase 3 clearance (80-90% root destruction)
- **Low operating costs:** R3,724-5,948 per pig (30-40% lower than commercial due to foraging)
- **High profitability:** R1.07M-1.98M revenue over 5 years, 40-50% margins

### Strategic Integration:

- **Sekelbos clearance:** 10-15 pigs clear 5ha in 4-8 weeks (root destruction)
- **Mobile paddocks:** Follow goat browsing, precede chicken scratching
- **Multi-revenue:** Meat (primary) + breeding (Mukota genetics) + value-added (bacon, ham)
- **Market flexibility:** Live sales (70%) + direct sales (20%) + premium Mukota (10%)

### Investment & Returns:

- **Infrastructure:** R96K-147K (phased over 3 years)
- **5-Year net profit:** R520K-950K (estimated)
- **ROI:** 509-606% (102-121% annually)
- **Payback period:** 1.5-2.5 years
- **Profit margin:** 40-50%

**This is not just pig farming—it's a strategic integration of rare Mukota genetics, three-way hybrid vigor, mobile extensive systems, sekelbos root destruction, and premium market positioning that transforms a low-input pig operation into a highly profitable, conservation-focused enterprise with extreme genetic rarity value.**

## SECTION 2: SEKELBOS BROWSING INTEGRATION

### 2.1 Goats as Phase 2 of Sekelbos Clearance

#### Clearance Sequence:

**Phase 1: Initial Assessment** (Baseline mapping)  
**Phase 2: Goat Browsing** ← Goats enter here  
**Phase 3: Mechanical Cutting** (Chainsaw, slash)  
**Phase 4: Pig Rooting** (Expose stumps, loosen soil)  
**Phase 5: Chicken Scratching** (Seedling control, fertilization)  
**Phase 6: Cattle Trampling** (Grass establishment)

#### Goat Browsing Strategy:

**Method:**
- High-density browsing (100-150 goats per 10-15ha)
- Short duration (7-14 days per paddock)
- Target: Leaf stripping, bark damage, seedling destruction
- Result: Weaken sekelbos, facilitate mechanical cutting

**Advantages:**
- **Revenue-generating clearance:** Goats gain weight while browsing
- **Selective browsing:** Goats target sekelbos over grass (80/20 ratio)
- **Access difficult areas:** Goats browse steep slopes, dense thickets
- **Reduce fuel load:** Consume leaves/pods before mechanical cutting
- **Cycle nutrients:** Goat manure fertilizes soil (high N content)

### 2.2 Browsing System Design

#### Paddock Layout:

- **Total area:** 600ha (after full clearance)
- **Goat paddocks:** 20 paddocks × 15ha each (300ha total)
- **Grazing duration:** 7-14 days per paddock
- **Rest period:** 60-90 days (longer than cattle)
- **Fencing:** Electric netting (goat-proof, 90cm height, 12 strands)

#### Stocking Density:

- **High density:** 100-150 goats per 15ha (intensive browsing)
- **Target:** Strip 60-80% of sekelbos leaves, damage bark
- **Duration:** 7-14 days (sufficient for damage, not overgrazing)
- **Rest:** 60-90 days (sekelbos weakened, grass recovers)

#### Seasonal Management:

**Spring/Summer (September-February):**
- Peak sekelbos growth (flush leaves, pods)
- High-density browsing (7-10 days per paddock)
- Goats gain weight rapidly (0.08-0.12kg/day)
- Target cleared areas (prevent regrowth)

**Autumn/Winter (March-August):**
- Dormant sekelbos (bark browsing, pod consumption)
- Longer browsing (10-14 days per paddock)
- Supplement lick blocks (maintain body condition)
- Focus uncleared areas (new clearance zones)

### 2.3 Phased Integration with Sekelbos Clearance

**Year 1: 50ha Cleared (Goat browsing on 50ha)**
- 35-goat herd (6 current + 29 purchased/born)
- 3-4 paddocks × 15ha (goat rotation)
- Revenue: R64K-124K (meat + dairy + breeding)

**Year 2: 150ha Cleared (Goat browsing on 100ha)**
- 60-goat herd (25 kids retained)
- 6-7 paddocks × 15ha
- Revenue: R120K-231K

**Year 3: 270ha Cleared (Goat browsing on 150ha)**
- 90-goat herd (30 kids retained)
- 10 paddocks × 15ha
- Revenue: R204K-357K

**Year 4: 420ha Cleared (Goat browsing on 200ha)**
- 105-goat herd (15 kids retained)
- 13-14 paddocks × 15ha
- Revenue: R267K-427K

**Year 5: 600ha Cleared (Goat browsing on 300ha)**
- 115-goat herd (10 kids retained)
- 20 paddocks × 15ha (full system)
- Revenue: R302K-499K

## SECTION 7: RISK MANAGEMENT

### 7.1 Production Risks

#### Risk 1: Drought (<250mm Rainfall)

**Impact:** Reduced browse quality, lower milk yield, kid mortality

**Mitigation:**
- Indigenous genetics (drought-adapted, 200-400mm tolerance)
- Supplement feeding (lick blocks, hay if severe)
- Destocking (sell non-essential animals early)
- Water security (multiple troughs, boreholes)
- Sekelbos pods (emergency feed, high protein)

**Financial impact:** R20,000-60,000 (supplement costs, lost revenue)

#### Risk 2: Disease Outbreak

**Impact:** Mortality, quarantine, veterinary costs, milk withdrawal

**Mitigation:**
- Vaccination program (clostridial diseases, pasteurellosis)
- Biosecurity (quarantine new animals 21 days)
- Indigenous genetics (natural disease resistance)
- Early detection (daily checks during milking)
- Veterinary relationships (rapid response)

**Financial impact:** R10,000-40,000 (treatment, lost production)

#### Risk 3: Predators (Jackal, Caracal, Baboon)

**Impact:** Kid losses (10-20% in high predator areas)

**Mitigation:**
- Night housing (kids penned at night)
- Guardian animals (donkeys, dogs - Year 2+)
- Electric fencing (deter predators)
- Rapid birth/bonding (kids follow mothers quickly)
- Indigenous genetics (strong maternal instincts)

**Financial impact:** R15,000-45,000 annually (lost kids)

### 7.2 Market Risks

#### Risk 1: Milk/Cheese Price Volatility

**Impact:** Revenue fluctuations, overproduction, spoilage

**Mitigation:**
- Diversified sales channels (farm shop, restaurants, retail)
- Value-added products (chèvre, aged cheese, yogurt)
- Flexible dairy herd size (shift does to meat production)
- Direct-to-consumer (build loyal customer base)
- Storage (freeze cheese, extend shelf life)

**Financial impact:** ±20-30% revenue variation

#### Risk 2: Meat Market Saturation

**Impact:** Lower kid prices, slower sales

**Mitigation:**
- Breeding stock sales (premium pricing)
- Timing (sell during religious holidays, cultural events)
- Live vs processed (flexibility based on market)
- Retain ownership (background kids if prices low)

**Financial impact:** R20,000-60,000 (delayed sales, lower prices)

### 7.3 Operational Risks

#### Risk 1: Labor Availability (Milking/Cheese-making)

**Impact:** Missed milkings, spoiled milk, lost production

**Mitigation:**
- Cross-training (multiple people can milk/make cheese)
- Simple systems (hand-milking, basic chèvre)
- Backup labor (family, part-time workers)
- Adjust herd size (reduce dairy does if labor limited)

**Financial impact:** R10,000-30,000 (lost milk, spoilage)

#### Risk 2: Infrastructure Failure

**Impact:** Spoiled milk, lost production, animal escapes

**Mitigation:**
- Backup refrigeration (generator, coolers with ice)
- Fencing maintenance (monthly checks)
- Equipment spares (extra buckets, molds)
- Simple technology (minimize complexity)

**Financial impact:** R5,000-20,000 (repairs, lost production)

## CONCLUSION

The Goat Dairy & Chèvre Production Enterprise is a strategic dual-purpose system:

### Key Strengths:

- **Indigenous genetics:** Rooikop goats optimal for 315mm rainfall (drought-adapted, browse preference, disease resistance)
- **Dual revenue streams:** Meat (R498K-841K) + Dairy (R502K) over 5 years = R1.05M-1.47M total
- **Sekelbos integration:** Goats browse sekelbos (Phase 2 clearance), generate revenue while clearing land
- **Low-input system:** 40-60% lower costs than commercial breeds (feed, health, infrastructure)
- **Value-added products:** Chèvre commands R180-280/kg (vs R20/L raw milk) = 9-14x value multiplication
- **Market diversification:** Meat, milk, cheese, breeding stock, agritourism = 5 revenue streams

### Strategic Integration:

- **70% meat-focused does:** Browse sekelbos, raise kids to market (extensive management)
- **30% dairy-focused does:** Hand-milked daily, produce chèvre (intensive management)
- **Flexibility:** Shift does between roles based on market demand, drought conditions
- **Herd growth:** 6 → 115 goats over 5 years (sustainable, manageable expansion)

### Investment & Returns:

- **Infrastructure:** R163K-298K (phased over 5 years)
- **5-Year net profit:** R592K-1.02M
- **ROI:** 310-281% (62-56% annually)
- **Payback period:** 2-3 years
- **Profit margin:** 65-70%

**This is not just goat farming—it's a strategic integration of indigenous genetics, dual-purpose management, sekelbos clearance, and value-added dairy production that transforms a low-input livestock system into a highly profitable, diversified enterprise.**
